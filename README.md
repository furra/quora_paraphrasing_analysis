# quora_paraphrasing_analysis

Some notebooks that apply LSA and Doc2Vec to the quora questions dataset.

The original csv file is [here](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/furra_uwo_ca/EdtgQlCZPidCnwhflhjPOPgBgx6s64YpEp_1-Kd9id8QKA?e=iewN9w).

The converted tsv (tab separator) is [here](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/furra_uwo_ca/EZ3c75E_4HhOjWNWSDMmdy0BHP-SYC5X-Meg2E-aqXZUmQ?e=JIYaom).

The tsv file should be downloaded to 'dataset/' so the notebooks can read it (or download somewhere else and change the location in the notebook).
